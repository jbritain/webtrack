## Open Source Video Motion Tracking

<img src="assets/screenshot.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 500px;">
This screenshot is not real, and uses a random image from the internet. I did not have any test footage that didn't contain my or a friend's face, so I created this because it felt like the website needed a screenshot if only to show what use of the program looks like.

## What is webtrack?
Webtrack is an open source tool designed for gathering position data from a video and using it to calculate things such as velocity.
It was created as an alternative to [Tracker](https://physlets.org/tracker/) as a fun project by [Pr0x1mas](https://pr0x1mas.github.io).

## What can it do?
Webtrack can

- Load and play back video
- Plot the positions of multiple masses throughout the video
- Display the positions in a table
- Calculate the speed of each mass throughout the video
- Graph any data gathered

## What people say about webtrack
