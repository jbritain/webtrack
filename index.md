## What is webtrack?
Webtrack is an open source tool designed for gathering position data from a video and using it to calculate things such as velocity.
It was created as an alternative to [Tracker](https://physlets.org/tracker/) as a fun project by [Pr0x1mas](https://pr0x1mas.github.io).

## What can it do?
Webtrack can

- Load and play back video
- Plot the positions of multiple masses throughout the video
- Display the positions in a table
- Calculate the speed of each mass throughout the video
- Graph any data gathered
